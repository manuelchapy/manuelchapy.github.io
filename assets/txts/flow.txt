We have 5 Ribbons inside Ribbon_Comp

Ribbon_A
Ribbon_B
Ribbon_C
Ribbon_D
Ribbon_E

Each Ribbon is unique so we need to pass the assets of the foods dinamically into this composition:

* Target_X comp contains a Shape Layer Column_X that needs to be replaced by a winning food and it needs to be the same food in all sub ribbons

* Random_A comp contains a Shape Layer Replace_XA that needs to be replaced by a random food. This random food needs to be unique in all sub ribbons

* Random_B comp contains a Shape Layer Replace_XB that needs to be replaced by a random food. This random food needs to be unique in all sub ribbons

* Double_Line comp contains a Shape Layer Replace_D that needs to be replaced by a winning food and it needs to be the same in all sub ribbons
